### Why you should use smirkcatchat instead of discord/slack/revolt??

1. 99% of app made using arch (only two lines in windows!!)
2. Typescript and tailwind for everything!! (idk differences between ts and js but denisc forced me to use ts)
3. Created just for fun

### How to use

1. Clone repo
2. Create `.env.local` in the root of the project
3. Edit it like this:

```
DB_HOST= *host, example: localhost*
DB_PORT= 3306
DB_DATABASE= *database name*
DB_USER= *user*
DB_PASSWORD= *password*
```
4. Import `base.sql` to database
5. `npm run dev`
6. Go to `localhost:3000`
7. Have fun!
